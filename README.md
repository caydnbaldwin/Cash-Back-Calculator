# Cash-Back-Calculator
A VBA program that calculates the total cost of a purchase after deducting cashback dependent upon subscribed membership-level.

## Instructions
Sub `CalcTotal` calculates the cashback for any purchase.  This business gives cashback based on the membership level of a customer, which is calculated using  `cashback amount = extended price * cashback%`. The user will enter the quantity, price, and select the membership level from the dropdown in cell `B7`. The code will determine, calculate, and fill in the highlighted cells. Cashback is earned only if the extended price meets or exceeds the minimum purchase for cashback.

## Applications
This program offers an automated method of calculated business transactions with multiple changing variables.
